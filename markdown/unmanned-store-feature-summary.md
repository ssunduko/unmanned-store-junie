## Background and Strategic Fit

-   [Unmanned Store Market Analysis](https://cableteque.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AT/pages/826049796)
    

## User Research

-   [Unmanned Store User Personas](https://cableteque.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AT/pages/826180179)
    

## Assumptions

**All Entry And Point-Of-Sale Endpoints Are Secure**

-   It is assumed that physical and digital store entry points use secure protocols and hardware to prevent unauthorized access.
    

**Customers Have Internet-Connected Mobile Devices**

-   Core user flows presume customers possess and reliably use smartphones or equivalent devices for registration, authentication, and notifications.
    

**Cryptocurrency Payments Are Supported By A Compliant, Real-Time Payment Gateway**

-   The chosen crypto payment provider can support the required settlement speeds and regulatory compliance (e.g., KYC/AML where necessary).
    

**Sensor And Appliance Hardware Is Able To Communicate With The Store Model Service In Real Time**

-   Network latency and device compatibility are sufficient for accurate, dependable event data transmission (less than 1s lag on core I/O).
    

**Store Inventory Is Properly Tagged And Digitally Represented**

-   All shoppable products have unique, trackable identifiers (e.g., RFID, barcodes, computer vision tags) mapped to virtual inventory in the Store Model Service.
    

**Customers And Devices Are Uniquely Identifiable**

-   Every customer, sensor, and appliance can be uniquely and consistently identified throughout their lifecycle in the system.
    

**24/7 Power And Network Connectivity Are Available**

-   Store infrastructure provides redundant power and network connections to minimize service interruptions or data loss.
    

**Operator And Support Staff Can Access The System Remotely At All Times**

-   Monitoring, remote troubleshooting, and system administration are possible without requiring on-site presence.
    

**All Collected Data Is Handled In Compliance With Relevant Data Privacy Regulations**

-   User data, transaction information, and sensor feeds are secured, stored, and processed in accordance with GDPR, CCPA, and local rules.
    

**Integration With Third-Party Systems (Payment, Identity, Support) Is Stable**

-   All necessary API partners (payment processors, identity verification, remote support, etc.) maintain sufficient uptime and backward compatibility.
